## 📥 Installation

### Windows
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/KarnesTH/karncrypt/releases/tag/v0.1.0) page.

**Important Note**: It is recommended to use the `karncrypt_x64-setup.exe` installer instead of the .msi version.

When downloading the Windows installer, you might receive a warning from your browser or Windows SmartScreen. This is because the application is currently unsigned (common for open-source software). The application is completely safe to use, and you can verify this by:
- Reviewing the source code in this repository
- Using the "More Info" → "Run Anyway" option in SmartScreen
- Choosing the .exe installer, which typically triggers fewer security warnings than the .msi version

### Linux
Choose the appropriate package for your distribution:
- .deb package for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
- .rpm package for Fedora/RHEL-based systems
- .AppImage for universal Linux compatibility
